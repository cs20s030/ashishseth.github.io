üñ•Ô∏è I am a Software Engineer at **Adobe, India**. Currently I am a part Marketing Automation Team within the Digital Experience division. My role centers on a segmentation project that utilizes AI to capture and analyze customer and sales insights. The project aims to enhance the overall business-to-business (B2B) marketing experience by refining segmentation processes.

üìñ Prior to this, I completed my master in **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** from **Indian Institute Of Technology (IIT), Madras, India**. During my academic tenure, I was privileged to be a part of [SPRING Lab](https://asr.iitm.ac.in/), under the guidance of [Professor S.Umesh](https://asr.iitm.ac.in/). Leading the team, I played a pivotal role in the design and implementation of cutting-edge Speech Recognition and Audio Classification models. My contribution within the lab involved development of innovative self-supervised methods for Audio Classification systems. This research culminated in the completion of my master's thesis, titled **"Towards General-Purpose Audio Representation Learning."** This academic pursuit not only enriched my theoretical knowledge but also provided valuable insights into advancing the field of audio processing and representation learning.

ü§ù Apart from my work, I also colaborate as an external researcher with [GAMMA Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/), under the guidance of [Professor Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha).

I am always open for external collaboration and discussing interesting ideas related to Self-Supervised Learning, Speech Recognition and Multimodality. You can find my latest papers in [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aBn1e34AAAAJ&hl=en).
